\title{Education}

\p{
I did a concurrent BEng in computer science and MSc in tech entrepreneurship at SUTD, Singapore.
}

\p{
Fun fact -- my dissertation was for my MSc, but I managed to wangle my way into doing a PL subject, since I'd realized by then that I was far more interested in that.
}

\p{
My motivation for entrepreneurship was as a means to find and work on technical problems that interested me, before I realized research was a possibility.
